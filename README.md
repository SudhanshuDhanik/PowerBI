🚀 Built an Interactive Power BI Dashboard! 📊

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I created a responsive Power BI dashboard that provides clear and insightful business analytics.

🔍 Key Highlights:

📊 Pie Chart to show category-wise distribution

📉 Clustered Column Chart for comparing Sales, Cost, and Profit

🌍 Map Visualization for region-wise performance

🎯 Cards displaying KPIs like Total Sales, Total Profit & Total Cost

🎛️ Slicer for Supervisor – select any supervisor to instantly view their performance across all visuals

🔗 Data Modeling was done using 3 interlinked files, ensuring accurate and efficient relationships between datasets.

✨ The dashboard is fully interactive – selecting a supervisor dynamically updates all charts and metrics to show relevant insights.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Power BI, data modeling, and creating dashboards that drive actionable decisions. 💡
